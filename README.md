** Directions for running the Pipe and Filters Program **

Structure: All source code is under the src directory. The java classes and jar executable are under the classes directory. 

1.) To run the program, ensure you are in the classes directory. 
2.) Once there, execute the command below:
    
    "java -jar App.jar"

3.) From there the program will prompt you to select what text file to run on. 
4.) Select which ever one you choose, and it will print the output. 
5.) To run again, execute the command from #2.
